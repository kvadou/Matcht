We want our people to take care of their health, body, and mind, and \"enjoy the ride\" while working here, since we're here for the long run — this is a marathon, not a sprint.Finally, we never say \"this is impossible\", but rather \"we don't know how to do it (yet)\", because we understand that our team is creating something that has never been done before.You can check out some testimonials from our team on our blog (<a href=\"https://medium.com/r2u/conhecendo-a-r2u-pelos-olhos-do-nosso-time-o-que-fazemos-nossa-cultura-crescimento-profissional-cf34940d3120\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/r2u/part2-conhecendo-um-pouco-a-r2u-pelos-olhos-do-nosso-time-o-que-fazemos-nossa-cultura-9610fd0c579\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/r2u/part3-conhecendo-um-pouco-a-r2u-pelos-olhos-do-nosso-time-o-que-fazemos-nossa-cultura-72adafb45813\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>).

The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript and introduces Python. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.

We help our users to type less, and talk more, so they can save time, communicate clearly and feel better connected.<br><br>The stack you will be working onOur current back-end stack is composed from Python (3.8.5), Flask/Gunicorn, AWS EC2, DynamoDB, Redis, Dramatiq, ffmpeg, nltk, headless Chrome with a supporting toolchain cast of Github, CircleCI, Clubhouse, Datadog and Sentry, and an assortment of SaaS integrations (Hubspot, Stripe, Customer.io, Amplitude, GCP and Azure speech-to-text and translation APIs). We are currently in the process of migrating to ECS with Terraform and upgrading our billing platform to Chargebee. The core Python codebase has decent test coverage (87%) which we want to increase over time. <br><br>The roleAs a full time back-end engineer typical duties will include:maintain and develop REST APIs to power our <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.justmote.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mote-voice-notes-feedback/ajphlblkfpppdpkgokiejbjfohfohhmk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrome extension</a>extend our Dramatiq/Redis powered workflows to more intelligently process user audio (eg to improve transcription and perceived audio quality). * integrate with third-party SaaS APis to support billing and analytics use casesenhance and backfill the user data model as we add more audio processing and analytics capabilities* maintain and improve our telemetry and monitoringprototype and prove explorations in new foundational frameworks and technologies to improve financial efficiency of architecture, reduce latency and improve developer productivityAs an early senior engineer, you will be expected to lean in and contribute significantly to a new team consensus on topics as varied as code maintainability, test automation, security, instrumentation and even when is the right moment to become polyglot with one or more of Clojure, Elixir, Go, Rust or Lua. <br><br>If you like “full-stacking” features, for either the technology variety (eg using/learning React), more holistic understanding of API usage or greater end-user intimacy, you are welcome to opt in to building unstyled client implementations; though this is not a requirement or expectation.<br><br>How we work<br>We are a remote-only Product and Engineering team based in Europe. We believe some synchrony while we remain small is a startup superpower for being able to stay nimble and flexible. Therefore, team members are expected to be significantly reachable on Slack and Zoom over a 6 hour window between 10 AM to 4 PM GMT during weekdays.We are not a huge fan of meetings, having all experienced megacorp meeting anti-patterns, but some high bandwidth communication is necessary for effective team collaboration. At a minimum, we have one weekly sprint retro and planning session, daily engineering stand ups and monthly company-wide town halls. Over and above that, we take a pragmatic, emergent view on the right communication tools and approaches for different types of collaboration, ranging from quick questions in Slack DMs, to tickets in Clubhouse, PRDs and tech specs in Google Docs, Swagger APi specs, Figma design specs, ad hoc Zoom sessions to brainstorm problems, and planned Zoom sessions to review designs or specs.Feedback is one of the core use cases of our product. We strongly believe a startup is an accelerated learning laboratory where the most important practise is to constantly and positively reflect on our behaviour and results, providing individual and collective feedback regularly.

We help universities, libraries, faculty and students to connect to the digital resources they teach and learn with, but more importantly to collaborate and engage with these resources.We have an established and market leading presence in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. We have well over 1.5million students and 100,000 academics using our products every day. We have two products at different stages in the product life cycle, and are now focused on growth of our more established product Talis Aspire, into large untapped markets and replicating our success of growth in our existing markets for our earlier stage product, Talis Elevate.We are a fully distributed team of passionate people with a culture that is informal, we have a fairly flat structure and we value accountability, delivering impact, transparency, collaboration and solving meaningful problems and customers success.You’ll be working in a friendly team that works closely and collaboratively, and supports each other in a safe environment. We have a shared commitment to our mission and goals, we like to deliver visible and measurable impact frequently, and to build and do the right things. We enable each other to continue learning, grow and to be always improving. We also like to get to know each other and have fun along the way.You will work as part of the engineering team, reporting to our CTO, comfortable working in teams that take pride in their code and have a structured approach to product development. You will be excited by transforming our impact onto higher education globally and be looking for a role that both inspires and challenges you.We are looking for an experienced full stack developer to join one of our development teams. You should be a polyglot programmer with experience on products with scale, performance and durable code and process.Our products were originally built exclusively in PHP, but we have largely migrated to a microservices architecture implemented in a variety of technologies including React, Angular, NodeJS, and PHP. The emphasis is on the right tool for the job, rather than worship at any particular technology alter.We run our services and applications totally within Amazon Web Services making use of Kubernetes, EC2, and Serverless technologies but you do not need to be familiar with these.We make extensive use of NoSQL technology. Our core data platform is currently MongoDB but we also use Redis, DynamoDB, Redshift, and PostgreSQL.We track, time and monitor everything that moves.

RequirementsYour job is to work with the rest of the development team to ensure new features – and new products – delight customers, ship on time, and are of a high quality.We’re looking for a developer, not just a great programmer – so your ability to question a spec and come up with a better outcome for the user is just as important as your ability to implement it.You’ll enjoy scaling and building for hundreds of thousands of users just as much as shipping a shiny new product to hundreds.You’ll be courageous in your approach to technology and not be afraid to undertake major changes if that is what is required to get the job done.You’ll share our appetite for unit testing, automated testing and continuous integration. You’ll likely have opinions on how to improve our approach to all three.Your code will be self-documenting, exhibit sensible and recognisable patterns, and your designs will be capable of being easily refactored as we scale, grow and further develop our products.Everyone is encouraged to ask a lot of questions here, so you should be ready for people to challenge and feedback on your approach and ideas, and vice versa.We are a fun, small, smart and close knit team. Every individual is expected to make a real and tangible difference to our success.We develop our people, our average tenure is over 5 years and now as part of the SAGE group, we can offer superb career progression for developers who are keen for new challenges.Able to work 100% remotely, but also able to travel for occasional company meetups.We’re open and transparent, and those that share in our values thrive and stay with us for many years. BenefitsWe are a values based company that uses words like trust, accountability and customer success and actually live them, most of our team are remote and we have worked hard to ingrain this in our culture.In addition to a very competitive salary, we offer:An exceptionally generous contributory pension scheme.Private medical insurance (after induction period).Immediate cover on an exceptional Health Cash Plan (including dental and optical cover).Flexible working hours – although we are small we have people on three continents and at many locations across the UK.Transparent reporting – every team communicates progress weekly to everybody – and you are free to ask questions or make suggestions.Equipment support to ensure you have the right working from home setup.We are a fully distributed company and are open to applicants across the UK, we are an equal opportunities employer and have a strong diverse team."
